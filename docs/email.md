Email
=====

I use the [aerc](https://aerc-mail.org/) terminal mail client for browsing my
email. Since I use [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/), I also need to use
the [proton-bridge](https://github.com/ProtonMail/proton-bridge) project to 
manage local email access.

In this case I defer setup to those links, along with this guide which helped
me get everything working:
